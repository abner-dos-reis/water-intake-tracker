## 🏗️ Architecture

### Why Docker?

This application was designed with **Docker containerization** for maximum flexibility and integration possibilities:

**🔗 Obsidian Integration**: The primary use case is running this app inside **Obsidian** using the **Web Browser Viewer** and **Custom Frames** plugins. Docker allows the app to run as a local web service that can be embedded directly into Obsidian notes, creating a seamless note-taking and health tracking workflow.

**🌐 Network Flexibility**: Docker configuration allows you to:
- Keep it **localhost-only** (default: `127.0.0.1`) for privacy
- **Open to network** by changing bind addresses to `0.0.0.0`
- **Restrict access** to specific IPs using Docker networking rules
- Use the app **anywhere**: in Obsidian on PC, mobile, or any device on your network

**📱 Cross-Platform Access**: Whether you're taking notes in Obsidian on your computer or accessing from your phone, the containerized app provides consistent access to your water tracking data.

The application follows a modern three-tier architecture:
